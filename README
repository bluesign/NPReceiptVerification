-----------NPReceipt-----------
Drop-in Mac App Store Receipt Verification

Installation:

1.) Add this file to your project
2.) Change the values of kReceiptBundleVersion and kReceiptBundleIdentifier at the top of NPReceiptVerification.m to your own values.
	These must be equivalent to CFBundleShortVersionString and CFBundleIdentifier, respectively. (These are found in your Info.plist file)

That's it!

Thank you to roddi's ValidateStoreReceipts which I used as an example and some code from.
